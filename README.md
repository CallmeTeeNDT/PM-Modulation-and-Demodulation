# PM-Modulation-and-Demodulation
This project was a collaborative effort completed by my classmates and me as part of our coursework in the "Analog and Digital Communications" class. The primary intention behind this assignment was to encourage independent exploration and deepen our conceptual understanding through guided research. To that end, our lecturer assigned this topic with the goal of helping us actively engage with the course material beyond the lecture hall.

To carry out the project, we first revisited the fundamental theories we had studied throughout the course, especially those covered in the core textbook "Introduction to ANALOG & DIGITAL COMMUNICATIONS" (Second Edition) by Simon Haykin and Michael Moher. This provided a solid theoretical grounding in the principles relevant to phase modulation (PM). However, in order to further enrich our knowledge and grasp of the subject, I also conducted supplementary research by consulting various online academic resources, including scientific papers, technical articles, and additional references related to communication systems and modulation techniques.

Following this research phase, we proceeded to apply the concepts through practical implementation. Using MATLAB as our primary simulation tool, we constructed examples that modeled both the modulation and demodulation processes of PM systems. Through these simulations, we were able to observe the systemâ€™s behavior under various conditions and evaluate its performance based on a set of technical criteria, thereby bridging the gap between theory and application.
